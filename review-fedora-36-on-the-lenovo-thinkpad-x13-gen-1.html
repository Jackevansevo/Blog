    <p><img alt="Thinkpad X13" src="/images/thinkpad-x13.jpg" title="Writing this post with a morning Coffee"></p>
<p>I recently picked up a used Lenovo Thinkpad X13 from eBay with the intention of
replacing my well loved Thinkpad X220 which is starting to show its age.</p>
<p>After a brief stint attempting to exclusively use WSL, frustrations with high
memory usage and intrusive Windows updates led me to try dual booting Fedora.
Overall it's been a positive experience and something I wish I'd done sooner.</p>
<p>This is just a quick run down of my experience with Fedora on the Thinkpad X13.
This isn't intended to be a review of the hardware, merely a first hand account
of how the distro performs/interacts when installed on the device.</p>

<h1>Upsides</h1>
<p>A quick rundown of things that have historically plagued Linux in the past, and how this distro compares:</p>
<ul>
<li>‚úÖ WiFi: works out of the box</li>
<li>‚úÖ Suspend resume appears to work</li>
<li>‚úÖ Closing the lid appears to suspend / hibernate the laptop</li>
<li>‚úÖ Function keys: all work</li>
<li>‚úÖ Fingerprint reader: works out of the box (which surprised me)</li>
<li>‚úÖ External HMDI monitor works when plugged in via USB-C hub</li>
</ul>
<h2>Gnome Desktop</h2>
<p>It's nice to see the Gnome Desktop continues to improve:</p>
<ul>
<li>I much prefer the new default horizontal workspace management on Gnome desktop</li>
<li>Coming from MacOS / Windows (or even alternate Linux desktop) this feels much more intuitive.</li>
<li>I'm a fan of the new GK4 Libadwaita theming, everything feels nice and consistent (providing you don't install an application outside of the Gnome ecosystem)</li>
<li>
<p>System performance feels really snappy, with low idle memory usage
<img alt="Resource Usage" src="/images/gnome-system-monitor.png" title="Resource usage with typical Django docker compose web-dev workflow"></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I like the new system wide dark/light theme preference</p>
</li>
<li>But I wish that similar to MacOS this could be toggle automatically during the day/night cycle (similar to the way night light works)</li>
<li>I haven't had a single desktop crash (so far)</li>
<li>I appreciate the new Gnome power mode settings, which lets me throttle performance to save power when away from my desk</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="Gnome power saver" src="/images/gnome-power-saver.png"></p>
<h1>Downsides</h1>
<ul>
<li>The builtin Gnome desktop screen/video recorder seemed to record choppy/laggy video</li>
<li>Would have been nice if this had worked smoothly out of the box but I was forced to revert to using OBS</li>
<li>Firefox struggles with video playback out of the box (perhaps media codecs are required)</li>
<li>Font rendering feels a bit lackluster on Fedora compared to the default MacOS or even Ubuntu experience</li>
<li>It's impossible to right click using the touchpad</li>
</ul>
