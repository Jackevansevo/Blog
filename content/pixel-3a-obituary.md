Title: ðŸª¦ Pixel 3a Obituary

It finally happened, last weekend I dropped my phone and the screen smashed.

This wasn't the kind of minor screen damage you sometimes see, where you can
continue to use the phone with a slightly degraded experience. Instead it was
the kind of damage that left me picking glass out my bleeding thumb in the
middle of a supermarket later the same day, not ideal.

I've previously dropped this phone more times than I can count as I'm
notoriously clumsy, but each time the phone miraculously escaped unharmed. So
I'm honestly surprised its lasted as long as it has. I've always stupidly prided
myself in being a person who'd never dropped and smashed their phone. But, alas
my luck finally ran out.

After getting home I looked around to see what it would cost to get it repaired.
The repair costs were nearing the cost for a completely new pixel 3a
replacement. This combined with the fact the device had received it's [last
official security
update](https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/4457705?hl=en-GB#zippy=%
2Cpixel-a-xl-and-earlier) meant it was finally time to say goodbye.

This is most expensive mobile device I've ever owned, and the first where I've
truly been blown away by the quality of the camera. For an affordable budget
phone, the shots this phone took were gorgeous, and to this day I think the
camera still holds its own.

It lasted exactly 3 years, 7 months and 25 days. Back in 2019 it cost Â£399 (and
came with a free Nest Hub). With works out to ~0.30p a day, which is pretty good
going.

So here's to you Pixel3a, you served me well.

Rest in pixels ðŸ“±ðŸ’€
