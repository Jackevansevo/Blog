# 1. Can it play media?

If not then how easy is it to find/install media drivers

If I open Firefox, and access a site that wants to play media using a non-free
codec, what will me experience be like?

# 2. Can it print?

If not then how easy is it to find/install printer drivers

Example: I recently had to print off some important documentation at my parents
house. My dad has a Brother Laser Jet printer and I found it an absolute
impossible task to find/install the necessary drivers.

It was less friction to upload the documents I required printing up to google
drive, and then print (using Google cloud print) from my Android phone.

Something simple like this could end up being a real deal breaker for wider
adoption of the distribution.


# 3. Does the desktop environment have any bugs

I recently tried Fedora 37 running Gnome, the default Wayland session has
a horrible bug where certain GTK applications don't appear in the ALT-TAB
window until after some very noticeable delay. This was enough to force me back
onto the X11 session.

The fact that these kinds of regressions can make it into a release seemingly
unnoticed is a shame. Perhaps I need to start beta testing ISO's and fixing
things instead of complaining.
