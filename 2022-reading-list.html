  <article>
    <p>One of my goals this year was to read more and to make a regular habit of
reading before bedtime. Particularly because I find reading before bed
significantly improves my quality of sleep.</p>
<p>I'm pleased as I managed to read a total of 15 books this year (an increase
from just 9 last year).</p>
<p>It's still not as many as I'd hoped to read, but there's always next year...</p>
<p>I have a suspicion I actually read more than this, but I just failed to track
certain books via good-reads. Next year I'll try to be more vigilant about
tracking which books I'm currently reading/read.</p>
<p>You can find a full breakdown
<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/year_in_books/2022/41733297">here</a></p>
<p>From this list the ones I most enjoyed are:
- Project Hail Mary (by the author of the Martian)
- Chaos Monkeys
- Disrupted</p>
<p><img alt="Reading List 20222" src="/images/www.goodreads.com_user_year_in_books_2022.png"></p>
<p>There's already some books on my radar for next year. I'd like 2023 to be the
year I finally conquer the Lord of the Ring trilogy. As a massive fan of the
films I think I owe it to myself to actually read the source material.</p>
