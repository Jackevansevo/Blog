  <article>
    <p>Recently I made the ambitious decision to move from the UK to Brazil to live
with my girlfriend. I just passed the one month milestone so wanted publish
something to mark the occasion. </p>
<p>It's my first time living abroad in a foreign country so thought it would be
fun to keep a record of any cultural differences or curiosities I observe along
the way.</p>
<p>These are written from the perspective of someone from the United Kingdom. So
depending on where you're from these may or may not be surprising.</p>
<p>In no particular order:</p>
<ul>
<li>It's normal to wear flip flops in the shower</li>
<li>You have electrical sockets/outlets in the Bathroom (not common in the UK)</li>
<li>You don't flush toilet paper down the toilet</li>
<li>There's no hot water when washing dishes in the kitchen</li>
<li>Knife and fork used in opposite hands</li>
<li>I tie my shoes differently</li>
<li>You don't fill up your own gas/petrol here</li>
<li>Recycling isn't very common</li>
<li>Every Bus has separate driver and ticket operator (in the UK the same person performs both roles)</li>
<li>WhatsApp completely dominates the market</li>
<li>Having a CPF (kinda like a social security number) is important for lots of
  things (although not 100% necessary)</li>
<li>Digital payments are very common here (Pix is hugely popular)</li>
<li>You can pay in installments for everything</li>
<li>Voting is done electronically</li>
<li>Lunch is a serious/main meal (in the UK it's common to just eat a sandwich)</li>
<li>People (mostly in the North) eat couscous for breakfast (kinda like cereal)</li>
<li>I ordered 'Limonada' expecting Lemonade (like Sprite) but received Lemon juice</li>
</ul>
